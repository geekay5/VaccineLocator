# Covid Vaccine Locator

The script locates a hospital offering vaccinations for all adults in India using Cowin platform's published APIs

The alarm feature is specific to Mac. It uses 'afplay' command to play a audio file. On other platforms change it by
using some other command instead of 'afplay' to play the audio file.

## Usage
### vaccineLocator.py [-p pin_code | -x district_id] [-a age]

#### Default Values

**pin_code = None**
**district_id = 294 (BBMP)**
**age = 18**

So, by default the script looks for hospitals in BBMP limits for age 18.

### This utility won't book a vaccine for you. It'll just search for available slots. You'll have to book the slot yourself using Cowin.

If you'd like to play around with the scripts you can use the following codes.
